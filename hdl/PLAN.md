# Tamal HDL — build plan / next steps

Living roadmap for the Clash gateware. Tracks what pure cores exist, what's
missing, and the order to build them. Anchored to the ISA & HDL Engine design
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-01-tamal-isa-design.md`, esp. §6, §10, §11), the
ALU/branch design (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-01-tamal-alu-branch-design.md`),
the register-file design (`.../2026-07-01-tamal-register-file-design.md`), and the
UART design (`.../2026-07-01-tamal-uart-design.md`).

## Where things stand

Every **pure leaf core** from the §10 module decomposition is built and
hedgehog-tested — the compute layer (ALU + branch), the **register file**, and
the **UART transport** included — and the keystone **`Engine.step`** Mealy is
built and hedgehog-tested too. The shell pieces built so far — the **instruction
+ ring BRAMs** (`Tamal.Mem`), the **wire-format core** (`Tamal.Wire`), and the
**UART load/drain loader** (`Tamal.Loader`) — are built and tested. What remains
is IOBUF and the real `topEntity` that wires everything to the pins.

Confirmed absent: the rest of the impure shell — IOBUF and the real
`topEntity` (the Engine + BRAMs wired to the pins).

## What remains: the impure `topEntity` shell

`Engine.step` is done and hedgehog-tested (92 engine+leaf properties). Every
*pure* core exists. What's left is the **impure shell** that lifts `step` onto
the board: memories, the host load/drain path, tri-state IO, and the top that
wires it all to the pins.

This shell decomposes into **five independently-startable pieces** (the first
three — **BRAM**, the **wire protocol**, and the **loader** — are now complete).
Each remaining one is meant
to be picked up in its own fresh session and taken through the repo's standard
cycle — **brainstorming → writing-plans → TDD** (see "Per-piece workflow" below).
Build order is **BRAM (done) → wire protocol (done) → loader (done) → IOBUF → topEntity**;
`topEntity` integrates everything and is deliberately last.

### Decisions already locked (apply across the shell)

- **Engine lift = plain `mealy`.** Wrap `step` with a thin adapter and lift it;
  `step` stays a pure, untouched, tested function:
  ```haskell
  stepM :: State -> BusIn -> (State, (BusOut, Maybe Ring))
  stepM s i = let (s', bo, mr) = step s i in (s', (bo, mr))
  engine = mealy stepM initState   -- Signal dom BusIn -> Signal dom (BusOut, Maybe Ring)
  ```
  No `mealyS`/`mealySB` and no `Bundle` instances for the engine (evaluated and
  rejected — the boilerplate is already factored into helpers, and the pure form
  keeps the cosim tests trivial). **Revisit `mealyS` for the loader FSM only** — a
  long sequential state machine is where the State-monad idiom actually pays off.
- **Memory geometry + `termAddr` reconciliation — RESOLVED (piece 1).** `Tamal.Mem`
  pins the instruction store at 1024 words (`AW = 10`, ≈ 1 BRAM36) and the ring at
  4096 words (`Unsigned 12`, ≈ 4 BRAM36), so `termAddr = maxBound :: Unsigned 12 =
  D − 1` is already correct — the engine needed **no** behavioral change (only a
  `termAddr` doc-comment). This 4096 value feeds the loader's drain length too.
 - **Wire-format gap — RESOLVED (piece 2).** The control/result framing now exists
   as a pure Clash core (`Tamal.Wire.Cobs` + `Tamal.Wire`, hedgehog-tested), so the
   loader has a contract to speak. The Rust `crates/tamal-abi` (`control`, `trace`)
   mirror stays a placeholder — deferred to post-silicon, to implement the same
   contract once the gateware is validated.
- **Board / XDC.** Arty A7-100T; USB-UART on the FTDI pins; eSPI pins on Pmods.
  `constraints/arty_a7.xdc` currently constrains only `clk` + `led`; every piece
  that adds pins extends it (pin numbers from Digilent's Arty-A7-100 master XDC).

### 1. BRAM — instruction + ring memories  *(done — `Tamal.Mem`)*

- **What:** two Clash `blockRamPow2`s (read-address + `Maybe (waddr, wdata)` =
  simple dual-port), in `hdl/src/Tamal/Mem.hs`.
  - *instr BRAM* (`instrRam`, 1024×32): read addr = engine `pcOut :: Unsigned 10`;
    write = loader `Maybe (Unsigned 10, BitVector 32)`; output feeds
    `BusIn.instrWord`. Its **1-cycle read latency is exactly the engine's `Fetch`
    bubble.**
  - *ring BRAM* (`ringRam`, 4096×32): write = engine `Maybe Ring` (as `Maybe
    (Unsigned 12, BitVector 32)`); read addr = loader drain counter; output streams
    to the loader.
- **Decisions made:** ring = 4096 (`Unsigned 12`) so `termAddr = maxBound = D − 1`
  needs no engine change; instr store = 1024 (`AW = 10`); zero-init (`repeat 0` →
  BRAM `INIT`); generic tuple write ports (no `Tamal.Engine` import — the topEntity
  projects `Maybe Ring`).
- **Depends on:** nothing (engine + Clash primitives).
- **Tested:** `Test.Mem` — a pure `refRam` oracle (+ `simInstr`/`simRing` samplers);
  6 HUnit cases (write-then-read-back, 1-cycle latency, read-before-write collision,
  address boundaries, ring drain sweep) + 3 hedgehog properties (model-equivalence
  at both widths + last-write-wins sweep). Spec + plan under `docs/superpowers/`.

### 2. Wire protocol — `Tamal.Wire` pure core  *(done — `Tamal.Wire.Cobs` + `Tamal.Wire`)*

- **What:** the transport-agnostic control (host→FPGA) and result (FPGA→host)
  byte framing, implemented as a pure Clash core: `Tamal.Wire.Cobs` (COBS
  encode/decode) + `Tamal.Wire` (LE word↔bytes, CRC-8 fold, frame + message
  layer). Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-02-tamal-wire-format-design.md`.
- **Delivered (v1):** control = `LOAD_PROGRAM(words…)` + `TRIGGER`; result = the
  `TRACE_DRAIN` frame (`REVISION … records … HALT terminator`). Frame =
  `COBS(opcode ++ payload ++ CRC-8) ++ 0x00`, little-endian (ISA §4).
  Fire-and-forget control plane.
- **Decisions made:** COBS `0x00`-delimiter framing (self-delimiting on both
  planes; dissolves the result-drain length/zero-gap problem); CRC-8 reused from
  `Tamal.Crc` (poly 0x07); no length field (COBS-implied); `Cobs` is a
  dependency-free leaf (`Maybe`), the frame layer owns `WireError`.
- **Deferred:** the Rust `crates/tamal-abi` mirror and `tamal-loader` (post-silicon;
  they implement the same contract). The gateware loader (piece 3) consumes this core.
- **Tested:** `Test.Wire` — COBS round-trip + 254/255 boundary vectors, LE
  round-trip, frame round-trips (control + result), CRC/corruption detection, and
  the error taxonomy (25 cases).

### 3. Loader — UART load/drain FSM  *(done — `Tamal.Loader` + `Tamal.Loader.Cobs`)*

- **What:** the impure FSM bridging `Uart` ↔ BRAMs ↔ engine control. **Load:**
  parse control bytes → write instr BRAM → pulse `startIn`. **Drain:** on
  `haltedOut`, sweep the ring BRAM → UART TX per the result framing.
- **Delivered:** `Tamal.Loader` — a plain `mealy` over a pure `loaderStep`
  (matching the engine lift) with an `RxControl → Run → Drain` lifecycle;
  streaming COBS decode/encode isolated as pure step functions in
  `Tamal.Loader.Cobs` and embedded in the mealy. RX = streaming decode + one-byte
  holdback + CRC-8 + LE word-assembly (write-through, 1024-word saturating cap);
  TX = ring sweep (`word[0..ringPtr−1]` + terminator) + streaming COBS encode +
  `0x00` delimiter, paced by `txReady`. The one engine change was the pure
  `BusOut.ringPtrOut` drain-depth projection (§4 of the loader spec).
- **Decisions made:** plain `mealy` over a pure step (not `mealyS`); the codec is
  pure step functions (no Signal-feedback plumbing); no UART flow control (Arty
  FTDI has no RTS/CTS) — tolerated by fire-and-forget + whole-frame CRC + COBS
  resync (spec D5).
- **Depends on:** BRAM (ports), wire protocol (`Tamal.Wire`, done), `Uart` (done), engine
  (`startIn`/`haltedOut`/`ringPtrOut`).
- **Tested:** `Test.Loader` — Signal-level harnesses (RX load, drain, robustness +
  re-run lifecycle) + pure codec properties against the `Tamal.Wire.Cobs` oracle
  (150 total suite). Both streaming paths were cycle-validated out-of-band before
  implementation. **Gotcha found + documented:** `sampleN` asserts `resetGen` on
  cycle 0 (Dom100 async reset), so a byte fed at cycle 0 is lost — `mealy`+`sampleN`
  harnesses must lead with one idle cycle (the `Test.Uart` pattern).

### 4. IOBUF — tri-state IO + sideband pins

- **What:** the bidirectional buffers for `IO[3:0]` (`oe → T`, `o → I`, pad
  `O → sampler`), plus `CS#`/`SCK`/`RESET#` outputs and the `ALERT#` synchronizer.
- **Decisions:** Clash `BiSignalIn`/`BiSignalOut` (`Clash.Signal.BiSignal`) vs
  instantiating the Vivado `IOBUF` primitive — decide in its spec.
- **Depends on:** engine `lanesOut` `(o, oe)` per lane; XDC pins.
- **Testing:** minimal (a vendor primitive / bidir signal) — validated in
  whole-top sim and on hardware.

### 5. topEntity — integration  *(LAST)*

- **What:** the synthesis entry point. Instantiate BRAMs + loader + `engine`
  (`mealy stepM initState`) + IOBUFs; wire the 100 MHz clock and all pins; extend
  the XDC; retire the heartbeat placeholder.
- **Depends on:** all of the above.
- **Testing:** `stack run clash -- Tamal --verilog` (codegen), then the full Vivado
  flow (`cd hdl && make`) to a bitstream, then on-hardware bring-up.

### Per-piece workflow (for each fresh session)

1. **brainstorming** skill → design doc at
   `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-tamal-<piece>-design.md`, committed.
2. **writing-plans** skill → TDD plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
3. Execute the plan test-first. Everything runs from `hdl/`: `stack test`,
   `make format` before each commit, `stack run clash -- Tamal --verilog` as a
   codegen smoke. Keep the split-license headers on new `hdl/**/*.hs` files
   (CERN-OHL-P-2.0).

## Ordering

1. **ALU + branch comparator** — done
2. **Register file** (16×32, `x0` = 0) — done
3. **UART transport** (8N1 RX/TX, NCO 16× oversample) — done
4. **`Engine.hs` — `step` Mealy** — done, hedgehog-tested
5. **BRAM** (instr + ring `blockRamPow2`; ring = 4096, `termAddr = maxBound`) — done, hedgehog-tested
6. **Wire protocol** (`Tamal.Wire` COBS + CRC-8 framing core) — done, hedgehog-tested
7. **Loader** (UART load/drain FSM; `Tamal.Loader` + `Tamal.Loader.Cobs`) — done, tested
8. **IOBUF** (tri-state IO + sideband pins) ← next
9. **`topEntity`** (integration; retire the heartbeat) — last

Short version: the pure leaves, the Engine keystone, the **BRAM memories**
(`Tamal.Mem`), the **wire-format core** (`Tamal.Wire.Cobs` + `Tamal.Wire`), and the
**UART load/drain loader** (`Tamal.Loader` + `Tamal.Loader.Cobs`) are all in place
and tested. The rest of the impure shell remains, decomposed into
IOBUF → topEntity — each its own spec → plan → TDD session, with
`topEntity` last.
